There are two scripts to this program: the Processor running on a raspberry PI and the reciever running on the Driverstation laptop that recieves video streams. The Rio and PI communicate over network tables (make sure to set the static IP of the Rio and the PC). 

The Pi script is called 'iSpyBlueBalls.py' and the laptop script is 'iRecieveBlueBalls.py'
